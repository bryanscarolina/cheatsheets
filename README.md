# Collection of Cheatsheets

 A growing list of the keyboard shortcuts for the apps I use. At least a few of these will be custom, but I will denote that at the top of the individual sheet. One example I can think of off the top of my head is my Hyper cheatsheet. 
   
 Although Hyper is an amazing terminal app, in this instance I am referring to my shortcuts set up for my Hyper Key (using Karabiner). 

 Below is a legend for the symbols used:

| **Symbol**  | **Key**     |
| :---------: | :---------: |
| `⇥`        |  tab        |
| `⇪`        |  caps lock  |
| `⇧`        |  shift      |
| `⏎`        |  return     |
| `⌘`        |  command    |
| `⌥`        |  option     |
| `⌃`        |  control    |
| `␣`        |  spacebar   |
| `⎋`        |  escape     |
